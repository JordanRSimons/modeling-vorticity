# Vorticity Modeling and Analysis - A Case Study

When waves approach the coastline, they can create complex circulating current patterns that trap ocean wildlife. Measuring these circulation patterns therefore benefits both oceanographers and ecologists. Scientists have recently developed a tool to compute vorticity by tracking how sensor buoys placed in the water move (Harms et al. 2023). The goal of this project is to compare this new model to more established ones while attempting to minimize the number of buoys required to get accurate results.

The animation below shows an example of simulated buoys, also called test particles, following a circulating current. The white penensulas represent land and the waves originate from the top of the plot.

# Important Note

This project illustrates my skills in modeling, data visualization, and scientific storytelling. Given the size of the datasets and the proprietary nature of the models, this repository does not include fully runnable code.

This research was supervised and mentored by Dr. Walter Torres and was supported by a US National Science Foundation “Research Experiences for Undergraduates” grant to the Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, & Ecosystem Studies.
