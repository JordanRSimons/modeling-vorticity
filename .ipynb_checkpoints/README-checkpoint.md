# Vorticity Modeling and Analysis - A Case Study

This repository contains an overview of Python modeling and data visualization done during a summer research project in applied physics and oceanography at the University of Washington.

Due to the size of the datasets involved and licensing concerns, this repo includes:
* Key plots, alongside narrative discussion and the code that produced them
* Code used to prepare model data and impliment an externally produced model
* My final research poster, created in PowerPoint
* A link to a 2-minute video I produced for the public about the project

# Project Overview

In coastal waters, wind-driven flow patterns can create circulating currents that can trap ocean wildlife. In this project, I aim to minimize the error of Lagrangian Gradient Regression (LGR; Harms et al. 2023), a novel modeling technique for computing vorticity (a measure of rotation in currents) via only recorded trajectories of objects in the water with respect to the established ocean model ROMS.

# Repo Contents
* 'notebooks/01_generate_particle_data': A narrative case study describing how I initialized test trajectory data for the LGR model
* 'notebooks/02_analysis_and_plotting': A narrative case study with four parts:
  * a showcase of plots, animations, and project results
  * a discussion of plot code
  * a technical discussion of the LGR technique and code
  * a walkthough of statistical analysis code
* 'images/': My plots and animations
* 'poster/': My research poster, created in Microsoft PowerPoint
* [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ3oBR151bI): A lighthearted 2-minute video introduction to the project intended for the general public

# Important Note

This project is intended as a portfolio piece to illustrate my skills in modeling, data visualization, and scientific storytelling, rather than a fully executable product.

This research was supervised and mentored by Dr. Walter Torres and was supported by a US National Science Foundation “Research Experiences for Undergraduates” grant to the Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, & Ecosystem Studies.
